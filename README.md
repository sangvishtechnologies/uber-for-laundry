# Why Build an Uber for Laundry?
The laundry sector is ripe for disruption. Traditional services can call for difficult drop-offs, uncertain pricing, and long wait periods. An on-demand platform answers to these problems by:
* **Convenience:** With a few clicks, you can schedule pickups and deliveries right at your doorway. No more carrying heavy laundry bags throughout town.
* **Transparency:** View price choices and estimated processing times up front. There are no unforeseen delays or hidden fees.
* **Efficiency:** Improve laundry services for busy individuals and families. Free up time for what is important.
* **Customization:** Provide many cleaning alternatives, including dry cleaning, gentle care, and environmentally friendly procedures. Meet your customer's various demands.

This convenience element leads to a growing market. The worldwide on-demand laundry industry is expected to exceed $113.24 billion by 2027 [source: Verified Market Research]. By creating an Uber for laundry, you're entering an industry with enormous potential.
